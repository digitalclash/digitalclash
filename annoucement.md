## Launching the First AI DApp Game Ever in History

Hi folks, 

We hope that you are as excited as us about the launch of the Digital Clash, because (1) It is historically the first DApp ever to incorporate an ml model (2) It is such an awesome, intellectually stimulating, and (potentially) financially rewarding game! 

### Pick a Team 

Simply put, there is a 28x28 canvas with a total of 784 pixels you get to draw on. You pick a team, either red or blue, and you try to draw over the pixels in order to make a digit appear on the canvas. You draw over the pixels by buying/staking them - the more a pixel changes hands, the higher its price becomes (so get all your friends to play!). The goal is to have one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (if you’re red) or 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (if you’re blue) appear on the canvas by the end of the round. 

Each round ends when the highest priced pixel reaches 100,000 keys, or the accumulated number of pixel transactions reaches 10,000, at which point the canvas freezes. An AI model trained on the famous MNIST handwritten digit dataset will then determine to which digit the canvas resembles the most. The winning team then divides the reward pool, formed by slices from the all pixel transactions during that round and the staked pixels on the final frozen screen. 

### Where can you play this? 

Right here: https://digitalclash.github.io/ (It is strongly recommended to read over the game rules carefully in order to win in this game).

You need to install Chrome and the Cortex wallet in order to play.  https://github.com/CortexFoundation/Cortex_Release/tree/master/cortex-wallet (follow the install instructions on this page)

If you’re interested in the details, we built the game on the Cortex blockchain because, well, we had no choice. They appear to be the only blockchain capable of running AI algorithms without being super expensive and they turned out to have off-the-shelf AI models ready for inference directly on their blockchain. They actually reached out to us and offered much assistance in navigating their environment. So thanks to the Cortex team! 


### And oh, who are we? 

We are a (relatively) new game dev team called DevBug and this is our first DApp game release. We missed the opportunity to write the first DApp ever, but at least now we are launching the first AI DApp game ever :) So much brain cells, sweat and tears went into designing and programming this game and we hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed writing it!


Sincerely,
DevBug Team
